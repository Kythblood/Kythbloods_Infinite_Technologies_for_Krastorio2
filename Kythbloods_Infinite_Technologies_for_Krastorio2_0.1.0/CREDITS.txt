Special thanks to Krastor and Linver for developing Krastorio 2.

While this mod does not contain any graphics or code from Krastorio 2,
some technology icons are using icons from their mod.

They are:
 - the Robot battery technology uses Krastorio 2's "robot-battery.png" as an icon
 - the Nanite enhancements (Health) and the Nanite enhancements (Speed) technologie 
   uses their "first-aid-kit.png" as a base layer and add masks to modify the icon


The gears in the bottom left corner of the Character crafting speed technology are 
an edited and downscaled version of an icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.

The gears in the bottom left corner of the Lab productivity technology are an edited 
and downscaled version of an icon made by ProSymbols from the Noun Project.


Most other graphics are edited versions of graphics from the factorio base game.
